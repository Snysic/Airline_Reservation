  ## üìÇProject Structure

The project follows the principle of separation of concerns, using three main layers:
- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests.
- Services: Manage business logic.
- Repositories: Interact with the database.

DTOs are used for data transfer between layers, and global exception handling ensures consistent error responses. Custom exceptions are employed for domain-specific errors, making the codebase maintainable, scalable, and easy to extend.
